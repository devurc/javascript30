# javascript30
A 30-day challenge to complete 30 Javascript projects in Vanilla ES6 JS - content from wesbo. 

## Day 1 - Javascript Drum Kit
A fun way to learn how HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together to render text, graphics, and respond to user input. Keys 'A' - 'L' were linked to HTML audio elements via data-key attributes and would play the associated audio element and animate via an added CSS class upon a keydown event. Another event listener was added to each key to listen for a transitionend event and remove the animation CSS, giving the impression of quick responsiveness.

## Day 2 - JS + CSS Clock
A project to connect real-world data to basic JS and CSS coding, using CSS to manipulate the display of the clock hands and using Javascript to move them based on the current time. 

## Day 3 - CSS Variables
Basic image attribute manipulation using CSS variables and Javascript. Learned how to use CSS variables to store information to be used across multiple elements, and how to use a couple new HTML input elements, namely range and color.

## Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1
Purely building basic knowledge of Javascript array prototype functions, including from, filter, map, reduce, sort. A look into the basics of functional programming, and the power of writing pure code. Also used function chaining to grab data from a Wikipedia webpage to return links in a particular section that had specific qualities using map and filter.
